# Sample code for *audio* or *Trulience AI* driven avatars

The sample code you can find at the links below embed a Trulience avatar directly into a ReactJS app and power it using either a pure audio mediastream of a combination of Speech-to-Text (STT), LLM/Conversational AI and Text-to-Speech (TTS) providers.

- [Audio Driven](/reactjs/audio-driven) - In this demo, the avatar is driven purely by a mediastream, making it easy to connect to the agent audio in any conversational AI platform.
- [Trulience AI](/reactjs/trulience-ai) - This demo uses a Trulience avatar set up to use Trulience-connected STT, LLM and TTS providers.
