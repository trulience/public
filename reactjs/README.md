The demos below, embed a Trulience avatar directly into a ReactJS app.

- [Audio Driven](./reactjs/audio-driven) - In this demo the avatar is driven purely by a mediastream making it easy to connect to the agent audio in any conversational AI platform.
- [Trulience AI](./reactjs/trulience-ai) - Trulience AI - This uses a Trulience avatar setup to use a Trulience connected STT, LLM and TTS provider.
