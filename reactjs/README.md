# Sample code for *audio* or *Trulience AI* driven avatars

The demos below, embed a Trulience avatar directly into a ReactJS app.

- [Audio Driven](/reactjs/audio-driven) - In this demo, the avatar is driven purely by a mediastream, making it easy to connect to the agent audio in any conversational AI platform.
- [Trulience AI](/reactjs/trulience-ai) - This demo uses a Trulience avatar set up to use Trulience-connected STT, LLM and TTS providers.
